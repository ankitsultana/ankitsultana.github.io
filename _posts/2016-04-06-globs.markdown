According to wikipedia, glob patterns specify sets of filenames with wild card
characters.

<p class="lead">But what the heck is a wild card character ?</p>

Again according to wikipedia, a wild card character is a character that can be
used to substitute for any other character or characters in a string. For
example in regex, `.` matches any character, and so `.` is a wild card character
.

Actually speaking about regex, as you might know `.*` is used to match any
number of arbitrary characters, which may be different, since `.` stands for *match any character* and
`*` stands for *match any number of* the preceding character.

The character `*` in this context, has a special name, **Kleene Star**.

So we know what is a wild card character, we know what is a regex (regular
expression), now coming back to the first definition on this page:

> A Glob Pattern specifies sets of filenames with wild card characters.

Examples of Glob Patterns in shell are:

{% highlight shell %}
rm *.out   # deletes all files that end with .out
ls -d _*   # list all files/directories that begin with _
ls -d */   # list all directories within the current directory
{% endhighlight %}

One important thing to note is that globs do not include the syntax for the
Kleene star.

Wildcard in Glob  |   Equivalent Regex
------------------|---------------------
`?`               |   `.`
`*`               |   `.*`

So say, for some reason, you are in a directory which has only markdown files,
and you want to list all files that have numeric names like `1234.md`. In regex
you could simply do `[0-9]+.md`, but you can't do that in globs

Notably, glob patterns are also used in git. You might use them frequently when
you are specifying a `.gitignore` file for your project.
