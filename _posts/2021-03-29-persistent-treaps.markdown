## Persistent / Immutable Treaps

<div class="callout">
<b>Prerequisites</b>: Should have a good understanding of Treaps (both Vanilla / BST  and Implicit), along with some basic understanding of BSTs and Segment Trees.
You can refer to the following tutorials: <a href="https://tanujkhattar.wordpress.com/2016/01/10/treaps-one-tree-to-rule-em-all-part-1/">Vanilla Treaps as BST</a>, 
<a href="https://tanujkhattar.wordpress.com/2016/01/10/treaps-one-tree-to-rule-em-all-part-2/">Implicit Treaps.</a>
</div>

If you are familiar with Treaps in Competitive Programming context, you'd know that there are two main operations that a Treap
fundamentally supports— split and merge.

The split operation takes a given treap and a value (say k), and breaks the given treap
into two treaps, one with values ≤ k and the other with values > k.

Similarly, the merge operation takes two treaps, say L and R, such that all values in L are ≤ all values in R,
and merges them to create a new Treap T.

Both these operations work in O(log(N)) (assuming N is the size of the treap before split or after merge).
As you might guess, irrespective of the provided value for splitting the treap or the skew in the size of the treaps before merging,
only O(log(N)) nodes are modified in total.

What if instead of modifying those O(log(N)) nodes, we created new nodes every time a modification is necesssary? That'd give us the following:

1. We'd have every "version" of the tree. A version of the treap is created every time you call split or merge.
2. You get *some* thread-safety for free. If it's okay to have multiple versions of the treap, then no locking/waiting is required.
3. If you merge two implicit treaps, then you have access to 3 implicit treaps (the 2 original and the merged one) with only O(log(N)) extra
memory.

The first and last property above are sometimes used in hard contest problems. However, before
going to the problems, let's see how persistent treaps work and look like:

### How Persistent Treaps Work

Let's consider the case for Implicit Persistent Treaps with the following arrays:

<div class="callout">
Implicit Treaps don't store the BST values explicitly and instead infer them from the subtree
sizes. These are used for doing operations on arrays, and allow you to perform pretty
mind-boggling stuff in O(log(N)) time, like reversing a sub-array, transplanting a sub-array
within the array, etc. while still supporting range aggregate queries like sum, min, etc.
in O(log(N)).
</div>

A = [1, 10, 3, 2, 1]

B = [2, 2, 2, 3, 4]

The array we get after merging A and B will be:

AB = [1, 10, 3, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4]

Let's say the corresponding treaps for the above arrays are called T<sub>A</sub>, T<sub>B</sub>, T<sub>AB</sub>.
Moreover, assume the aggregate function we have to maintain is simply sum
to answer range sum queries over the arrays.

#### Persistent Treap Merge Operation

Let's walk through a merge operation call for the treaps T<sub>A</sub> and T<sub>B</sub> to generate T<sub>AB</sub>

The nodes in the following diagrams represent the following:

<div style="text-align: center">
	<img style="max-width: 300px; text-align: center" src="/images/treap-diagram-legend.png" />
</div>

Let's say treaps T<sub>A</sub> and T<sub>B</sub> look as follows.
Note that the heap values are generated randomly,
and hence we can get a different treap for a given array every time. Also, the treaps in this
tutorial are min-heap ordered.

<div style="text-align: center">
	<img style="max-width: 600px; text-align: center" src="/images/persistent-treap-image-2.png" />
</div>

Now if we call merge for the treaps T<sub>A</sub> and T<sub>B</sub>, the first merge call will pick the node corresponding
to A[2] since that one has a lower heap value (11). Moreover, as is the case usually with merge operations
, if we pick the treap on the left (T<sub>A</sub>), we will keep it's left-child as is and call merge with the left treap's
right child (A[4]) and the full treap on the right (T<sub>B</sub> or B[1]).
This looks as follows:

<div style="text-align: center">
	<img style="max-width: 600px; text-align: center" src="/images/persistent-treap-image-3.png" />
</div>

Now, we will pick the node corresponding to B[1] since that one has a lower heap key (21), keeping
its right child as is and calling merge with its left-child. This looks as follows:

<div style="text-align: center">
	<img style="max-width: 600px; text-align: center" src="/images/persistent-treap-image-4.png" />
</div>

Finally, we pick the node corresponding to A[4] and take its left child as is, and call merge
with the node corresponding to B[0] and A[4]'s right-child, which is NULL. That will yield
the following treap structure (before recursion has returned):

<div style="text-align: center">
	<img style="max-width: 600px; text-align: center" src="/images/persistent-treap-image-5.png" />
</div>

When the recursion stack returns, the aggregate functions will be corrected for the nodes
to yield this final state:

<div style="text-align: center">
	<img style="max-width: 600px; text-align: center" src="/images/persistent-treap-image-6.png" />
</div>


Note that the number of new nodes created is O(height(T<sub>A</sub>) + height(T<sub>B</sub>))
which is O(log(N)) with a fairly high probability.

As you can see in the last image above, even after merging the original two treaps, you
have complete access to both the original treaps as well as the merged treap. Also note
that none of the original treap nodes are modified (immutability).

#### Persistent Treap Split Operation

Let's also walk through a split operation for the treap T<sub>A</sub>.
Let's say the key for splitting is 3, meaning we should break the treap into
two treaps, one with array elements with indices <= 3 and the other with
indices > 3. Since A had five elements, the treap on the left should have 4 elements
and the treap on the right should have a single element.

This is how treap T<sub>A</sub> initially looks:

<div style="text-align: center">
	<img style="max-width: 600px; text-align: center" src="/images/persistent-treap-image-7.png" />
</div>

In the first call for split, since the node A[2]'s BST Value (array index, i.e. 2) is
less than the splitting key (which is 3), we create a new node and make this the root
of the left treap. The recursive call for split is made for the sub-treap rooted at A[4]
(as shown below).

<div class="callout">
<b>Reminder</b>: In regular treaps (non-persistent), when we call split and the current node's
value is <= the splitting key, we assign that node to the left output treap of the split call,
keeping the left sub-treap / child of the current node as is, and call split recursively on
the right sub-treap. Similarly, if the value of the current node is greater than the
splitting key, we assign that node to the right output treap of the split call, keeping
the right sub-treap / child of the current node as is, and call split recursively on
the right sub-treap.
</div>

<div style="text-align: center">
	<img style="max-width: 600px; text-align: center" src="/images/persistent-treap-image-8.png" />
</div>

Now, the split operation is called for node A[4], and since that has a higher BST Value (4)
than the splitting key (3), we make this the root of the right treap and call split on the
left sub-treap of A[4] (i.e. A[3])

<div style="text-align: center">
	<img style="max-width: 600px; text-align: center" src="/images/persistent-treap-image-9.png" />
</div>

Finally, the split call reaches A[3] and since its value is <= splitting key, we make this
the right child of the left treap.

<div style="text-align: center">
	<img style="max-width: 600px; text-align: center" src="/images/persistent-treap-image-10.png" />
</div>

Finally, when the recursion stack returns and the aggregate function (sum) is recomputed,
we get the following final treap:

<div style="text-align: center">
	<img style="max-width: 600px; text-align: center" src="/images/persistent-treap-image-11.png" />
</div>


### Sample Problems

**Problem-1:** [Codechef August 2010 Challenge / Problem: GENETICS](https://www.codechef.com/problems/GENETICS)

You are given a bunch of DNA sequences (in a list called L), and you have
to support the following operations:

1. CROSS id1 id2 k1 k2: Create two new DNAs from DNA[id1] and DNA[id2] and add them to L: L.append(L[id1][:k1] + L[id2][k2+1:])
and L.append(L[id2][:k2] + L[id1][k1+1:])

2. MUTATE id1 k X: Set the base at index k for DNA L[id1] to X (X will be either of 'A', 'G', 'C', 'T')

3. COUNT id1 k1 k2: Return number of each of the 4 bases in DNA L[id1] between indices k1 and k2.

**Solution:**

This is a direct application of persistent treaps. The aggregate function
will need to track sum for each of the 4 bases (AGCT). You can find my Accepted
implementation here: [Gist on GitHub](https://gist.github.com/ankitsultana/8de729056a961c346790e789cb982da1)

You can see the split and merge methods below, which create a new node for every visited node:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/ankitsultana/ba595135f1287350c692dc7e449becb7.js"></script>

This question also requires you to support point updates (setting a given element to a given value).
This can also be done by keeping the treaps immutable. Refer to the
[point_update method in the implementation](https://gist.github.com/ankitsultana/8de729056a961c346790e789cb982da1).

One important caveat for my linked solution (and even other implementations for this problem) is that there are some memory
leaks (Can you figure out where?). However, the memory limit is high enough that it doesn't become an issue.

**Problem-2:** Problem C from Day-4 of Summer Petrozavodsk Camp
([statements](https://github.com/wcysai/Calabash/blob/master/Petrozavodsk%20Summer-2017.%20Ruyi%20Li%20Contest%202/statements.pdf))

You are given an array with N (<= 2e5 elements) and you have to support the
following 3 operations:

1. SUM L R: Return the sum of all elements between indices L and R (both inclusive).
2. REP L R K: Modify the array as per the following pseudocode:
for (int i = l; i <= r; i++) A[i] = A[i - k];
3. REVERT L R: Change all elements in indices L and R to their original value.
